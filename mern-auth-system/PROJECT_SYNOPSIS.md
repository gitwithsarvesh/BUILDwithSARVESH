# 📄 Project Synopsis

## 🔷 Title:
**MERN Authentication System with Password Reset, Email Verification, and JWT Authentication**

---

## 🔷 Objective:
To develop a secure and scalable authentication system using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack that handles user registration, login, email verification, JWT-based authentication, and password reset functionality with real-time email notifications.

---

## 🔷 Problem Statement:
Most web applications require secure user authentication mechanisms. A lack of proper security features like token-based authentication, email verification, and password recovery can expose systems to unauthorized access and data breaches. There is a need for a modular, full-stack authentication system that developers can integrate into any web application.

---

## 🔷 Scope of the Project:
* Full-stack authentication using MERN stack
* Email verification after user signup
* Secure JWT token-based login system
* Password encryption using bcrypt
* Password reset functionality via email with secure tokens
* Protected routes implementation (user dashboard, etc.)
* Responsive and user-friendly interface
* Easily integrable and scalable architecture
* Real-time notifications and feedback
